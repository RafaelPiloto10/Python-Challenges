# Python-Challenges
http://www.pythonchallenge.com/

Python Challenges is a cool and fun way to test your python skills through a series of puzzles.
I have created this repo to share my take on the challenges and track my progress as I grow.

I am using Python version ```3.6.4``` for these challenges.
